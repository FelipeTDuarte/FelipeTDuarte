ðŸ‘‹ 
Hi, Iâ€™m Felipe Teixeira Duarte, a Civil/Environmental engineer specializing in offshore and coastal environments, with a passion for marine renewable energies (MRE), data analytics, optimization algorithms, and numerical modeling.

ðŸŒŠ What I Do
I am a Ph.D. candidate in Hydraulics, Water Resources, and Environment at the Faculty of Engineering, University of Porto. My research focuses on optimizing wave energy converter (WEC) farms using evolutionary algorithms, numerical modeling (e.g., SWAN, SWASH, OpenFOAM), and environmental assessments.

ðŸ¤– Technical Interests

Numerical modeling for coastal and offshore applications.
Optimization techniques leveraging AI and evolutionary algorithms.
Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and fluid-structure interaction.
Data analytics and database management with Python and MATLAB.
ðŸ“ˆ Skills

Proficiency in SWAN, SWASH, Delft3D, OpenFOAM, and SNL-SWAN.
Advanced data analysis and optimization techniques.
Expertise in environmental impact assessments and hydromorphodynamic modeling.

ðŸš€ Current Goals
Iâ€™m exploring multi-objective optimization for hybrid offshore energy farms and investigating their synergies with coastal protection strategies.
